# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This prework study guide was created so I can study everything I need to know about web development in one place. I learned how to code and debug in several categories such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also learned all about git hub, how to navigate my computer using command line, and overall how to think like a web developer.
